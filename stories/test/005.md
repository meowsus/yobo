You enter **Room D**. It's nondescript in almost every way.

There are two doors in front of you, marked **Room E** and **Room D**. There is
also a shimmering, fractal-like apparition you can half-see (if you look at it
the right way). Oh, wait, it's another door, ominously marked **Room X**. You
try it and it's locked. Bummer.

> **Ending B** feels lame, but **Room F** feels twice as lame. I hope you have
> that keycard...
